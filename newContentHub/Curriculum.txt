Curriculum

    Years 1-9
        The curriculum used between year 1-9 is an international one and is designed to prepare you for the IGCSE & IB courses. Rather than only teaching you about certain topics & material, the curriculum also teaches you how to learn effectively.

    Year 10-11
        For years 10-11 we follow the iGCSE course: You choose 4 subjects from 4 categories & English + Math
        - Humanities
            - Economics
            - Geography
            - History
            - Sociology

        - World Languages
            - Spanish
            - French
            - Dutch

        - Creative
            - Designer Technology
            - Art
            - Computer science
            - Drama
            - Music
            - Physical Education

        - Science
            - Triple science - Teaches harder content & awards 3 GCSE's (Chemistry, Biology, Physics)
            - Double science - Teaches easier content & awards 2 GCSE's (Top 2 highest scoring sciences)

        - Mandatory
            - Math
            - English

        Alternatively, you can take the BISH ICE route, which is a continuation of the international curriculum of years 1-9. This option is normally taken by students for whom the IGCSE is not required for their future academic career.
    Year 12-13
        For years 12-13 we follow the IBDP course wherein, you choose 6 subjects from 6 categories.

        From those 6 you must also choose 3 subjects to study at a higher level (HL) and 3 subjects at standard level (SL).
        HL is harder, covers more content, and requires more teaching time in comparison to SL.

        - Group 1 - Studies in language and literature
            - Language A: English literature
            - Language A: English language & literature

        In each of your subjects, you will also need to do an Internal Assessment which is an essay about a certain aspect of the course content.

        To add to this, there are also 3 additional requirements to the IB course:
            - CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service)
                CAS is a record of extra-curricular activities that fit into one of the three strands: Creativity, Activity & Service. Overall you will need around 24 CAS experiences (or ~100 hours) over the 2 IB years, and at least 1 CAS project.

                A CAS project is a collaborative CAS experience that comprises a series of CAS experiences.

                There are set requirements that must be met for something to be considered a CAS experience or project:
                    - Must be supervised/ verified by a non-parental adult
                    - Must be something you would not do normally (Getting a driver's license)
                    - You must not profit financially from the experience (Start a small business)

            - TOK (Theory of knowledge)
                TOK is an extra lesson that teaches epistemological philosophy which is a branch of philosophy that teaches you about knowledge itself and how you can gain and transfer it.

            - EE (Extended Essay)
                The extended essay is a research paper that you must write across your 2 IB years, in a specific subject of your choice. It can be about anything that you want but should pursue topics outside of your IB course.
