    BISH has a set uniform that all students must wear which can be purchased from Dennis or the online store.

            - BISH polo shirt
            - Navy blue skirts

        Boys must wear:
            - BISH polo shirt

    Every Friday is a spirit day where you are allowed to wear any clothing provided by the school.
    Examples of these are:
        - Team shirts
        - Regular school uniform
        - Merchandise from the spirit store

    As well as this, all students must wear an ID badge at all times which are the key to safety as it helps the school identify who you are.

    Additionally, they can be used to pay for school lunch by setting up a FlikDining account and having your parents putting some amount of money into it. You can then use it to buy snacks, drinks and lunch from the Boma and your parents will be able to track the usage and refill it accordingly.

    If you ever forget your ID badge you will need to get a temporary visitor badge from the reception. If you also have school lunch, you will need a lunch pass from your form tutor.

    If at any time you lose the string or case for your lanyard then you can get it replaced for free at the reception. However, if you lose the actual card then there is a 10$ fee to get it replaced.
