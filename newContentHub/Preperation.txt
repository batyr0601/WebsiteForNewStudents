Preparation

    During the school day, there are many things you need to bring from home in preparation. It is required for secondary students to bring in their own stationary this includes:
        - Pens
        - Pencils
        - Eraser
        - Ruler
        - Calculator
        - Glue
        - Pencil case

    Additionally, Year 9 and below will be given an iPad to help facilitate their learning and are required to bring it in every day.
    However, Year 10 and above will be required to bring in their own device (preferably a laptop).


    On top of that, our school has a set uniform that all students must wear. All uniform can be purchased from Dennis or the online store.
        Girls must wear:
            - Navy blue skirts
            - Black trainers
            - BISH polo shirt

        Boys must wear:
            - BISH polo shirt
            - Navy blue pants
            - Black trainers

    Every Friday, it is a spirit day. A spirit day you are allowed to wear any clothing provided by the school examples of these are:
        - Merchandise from the spirit store
        - Team shirts
        - Regular school uniform
        - Anything that shows BISH spirit!

    As well as this, all students must wear an ID badge at all times. ID badges are the key to safety as it helps the school identify who you are. Additionally, ID badges have other uses. They are able to unlock some of the doors in and out of the school. They are also what we use to pay in school. Your parents can set some amount of money onto your ID badge. You can then use it to buy snacks, drinks and lunch from the Boma. Your parents will be able to track the usage and refill it accordingly. If you ever forget your ID badge, you will need to get a temporary visitor badge from the reception and if you have school lunch, you will need a lunch pass from your tutor. If at any time you lose your lanyard (the string/ case that holds your ID badge) then you can get it replaced for free at the reception. However, if you lose your card then there is a 10$ fee to get it replaced.
