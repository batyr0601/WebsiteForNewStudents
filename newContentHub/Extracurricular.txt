Extracurricular

    CCA
        CCA's or co-curricular activities are extra-curricular activities that you can pursue after school such as sports or clubs.

        A CHQ signup form is sent out via email every 11 weeks asking for you to sign up for CCA's.

        There are also paid CCA's which are either offered by an external company; award a certificate upon completion; require non-reusable equipment.

        There are also CCA's which are not out of school but are during lunch & break times.


    Enrichments
        On Tuesdays and Thursdays, there are blank spots in 3B which are reserved for enrichments.

        Enrichments are similar to CCA's where you can pick and choose activities and clubs to do during school time.

        You have to attend the enrichment for an hour every Tuesday and Thursday for one hour and after 11 weeks, you can change your enrichment to something different.

        Furthermore, every year you need to do an enrichment from each of these categories: Creativity, Activity, Service & a Mi-Learning project.
            A Mi-Learning project is a time allotted to pursue anything you are interested in. In fact, this entire website was the product of a Mi-Learning project.
