School Layout and Location

    Our school is located on the west side of Houston in the Katy region.
        The school is very large but is actually extremely easy to memorize and remember.

        Our school has four floors and every floor is split up into separate subjects groups. For our current year the layout looks like this:
            1st Floor - Admissions, Accounting, Principals office, staff, BOMA, Gym, Welfare
            2nd Floor - Languages, Math, Art, DT
            3rd Floor - Humanities, Sciences, Computer science
            4th Floor - Math, Sciences

        Every floor is split up into different neighborhoods. Neighborhoods are a subject specific area of our school.
        For example, the English neighborhood is on the 4th floor, there are six classrooms designated to English and the corridor.
        During independent tasks, your teacher may allow you to work anywhere in the neighborhood.


        Neighborhoods vary every year. There are also year group neighborhoods where you will go during the day to register, have form time and store any of your belongings. These can, and will, change every year but you will be notified at the beginning of the year.
        You can find the full map to the school here.

        However, if you would like a more comprehensive map continue to the end.
        Due to subject neighborhoods changing, we will not include the labels to all subjects.
