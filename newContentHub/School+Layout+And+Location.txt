School Layout and Location

    The school is very large but is actually extremely easy to memorize and remember.

    Our school has four floors and every floor is split up into separate subjects groups. For our current year the layout looks like this:
        1st Floor - Admissions, Accounting, Principal's office, staff, BOMA, Gym, Welfare
        2nd Floor - Languages, Math, Art, DT
        3rd Floor - Humanities, Sciences, Computer science
        4th Floor - Math, Sciences

    Every floor is split up into different neighbourhoods. Neighbourhoods are a subject-specific area of our school.
    For example, the English neighbourhood is on the 4th floor, there are six classrooms designated to English and to the corridor.

    During independent tasks, your teacher may allow you to work anywhere in the neighbourhood which means that you can leave the classroom and work in another classroom or in the middle section.

    There are also year group neighbourhoods that you will go to at the beginning of the day to register, have form time, and store any of your belongings. These can, and will, change every year and you will be notified at the beginning of the year.


    Neighbourhoods may vary every year so the information here won't be strictly correct for future years, the science & art rooms are an exception as they contain subject-specific equipment. This is also why we won't include the labels to all subjects in the map above.
