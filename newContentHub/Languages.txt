Languages

    BISH provides many different languages for you to take. From Years 1-9 you will learn both French and Spanish but at GCSE you will need to pick one or the other.

    Mother Tongue
        However, BISH also teaches native languages for people. This programme is called the Mother tongue programme. Mother tongue is for people that speak a certain language fluently. Most mother tongue languages are during an enrichment, unless there is a CCA for it, as well.

        These sessions are there to maintain your skills in your native language so you will not have to come back to the basics and learn the language all over again, in case you move back. Your mother tongue can also be possibly taken as a subject, such as Dutch, thus replacing Spanish/French.

        As well as this, BISH will also offer GCSE's for native languages so if you are fluent in German, the school will provide whatever you may need to carry out the GCSE exam.

    EAL/ESL
        If you cannot speak English very well, then the school will provide a EAL/ESL course for you. EAL/ESL stands for English as Additional Language/English as a Second Language. This will help you learn the language much faster. We did this for about 1.5/1 year and it helped a lot, giving us that extra time and support to catch up with the rest of the class. You are also most likely to have a different timetable than the rest: it will be more focused on learning the language. For example, sessions of an additional language like French or tutor time will be replaced with EAL classes.
        By the end of the course, you will achieve an intermediate or higher level of English and carry on with a usual timetable.
