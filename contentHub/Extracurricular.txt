    CCA
        CCA's or Co-Curricular activities are extra-curricular activities that you can pursue out of school.

        It is designed to broaden your scope on learning so that you can learn about different things.

        A CHQ signup form is sent out at the end of every 11 weeks asking for you to sign up for CCA's. Most of these are sports related and include you playing in the school team. There are also paid CCA's which are offered by outside companies that teach you even more in depth about different topics. An example of this is, Tae Kwon Doe.

        There are also CCA's which are not out of school but are during school. These include choir wherein, you must practice singing with the choir on a specific schedule.
