Rules and Values

    In our school, we have three main values: Pride, Unity, Respect. They have been developed by students and apply to the entire school community.
        Have pride in all that you do, be proud of your school, be proud of your community.
        We are a wonderfully diverse community, we stand together and are united as one.
        We respect one another, without question and always conduct ourselves in a respectful manner.
